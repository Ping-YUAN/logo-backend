As the backend is developed with nestjs which is on top of the `ws` libaray. 
It's kind of different protocals. So i have override the client.js with `ws` so that the test can work well. 

To run the test: 
run `npm install`
run `npm run test`

In the console you will see the output. along with the render result; 

If you want to play you can also go to the logo-backend project and check more details in `readme.md`
